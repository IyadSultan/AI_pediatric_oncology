        "Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) are harmful or unpleasant effects caused by medications when used at normal doses. Identifying ADRs in text is crucial for patient safety and pharmacovigilance.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this tutorial, we tackle two common NLP tasks for ADR detection in clinical or biomedical text:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** – extracting the specific text spans that describe ADRs in clinical narratives or reports.  \n",
        "- **Text Classification** – determining if a given document or sentence contains any mention of an ADR (yes/no).\n",
        "\n",
        "We will use a BERT-style pre-trained model specialized for biomedical text and fine-tune it for both tasks. Pre-trained models like **PubMedBERT** (also known as **BiomedBERT**) are trained from scratch on large biomedical corpora (e.g. PubMed articles) and achieve state-of-the-art performance on biomedical NLP tasks. Such domain-specific pretraining is beneficial – research shows it yields substantial gains on domain tasks compared to using general-language models.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this tutorial, we’ll use **PubMedBERT** as our base model (you could also use similar models like **BioClinicalBERT**, which is trained on clinical notes, or **BioBERT**). We’ll fine-tune the model on an English-language ADR dataset from the Hugging Face Datasets Hub and demonstrate end-to-end training and evaluation on both NER and classification.\n",

        "# Dataset for ADR Extraction and Classification\n",
        "\n",
        "For this tutorial, we use the **ADE-Corpus V2** dataset, a public benchmark for adverse drug event detection. This corpus consists of sentences from biomedical reports. Each sentence is labeled whether it contains an adverse drug effect (ADE) or not, and ADR mentions are annotated within the text. The dataset is conveniently available on Hugging Face Hub (ade_corpus_v2). According to its description:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Text Classification**: Each sentence is labeled as ADE-related (contains an ADR) or not. (ADE is another term for ADR in this context.)\n",
        "  \n",
        "- **Relation/NER Annotations**: For sentences with ADRs, the dataset provides the specific drug and the adverse effect mentioned, along with their positions in the text. We will use these to derive entity labels for NER (specifically, the ADR spans).\n",
        "\n",
        "The dataset also includes sentences with no ADRs (these come from a file of negative examples), which are important for training both tasks (they serve as negative examples for classification and should produce “no entity” for NER).\n",
        "\n",
        "Using this dataset, we can construct what we need for both tasks:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. A **classification dataset** of sentences with a binary label: ADR-present (1) or no ADR (0).\n",
        "2. A **NER dataset** of the same sentences, with token-level labels tagging the ADR mention spans. We will use a simple BIO tagging scheme:  \n",
        "   - **B-ADR** (beginning of an ADR entity)  \n",
        "   - **I-ADR** (inside an ADR entity)  \n",
        "   - **O** (outside any ADR). Since we only care about ADR entities, any other tokens (including drug names) will be labeled \"O\".\n",
        "\n",
        "By using one dataset for both tasks, we ensure consistency: the classification positive examples contain the same ADR spans that the NER model will extract.\n",

        "\n",
        "In this tutorial, we demonstrated how to fine-tune a modern biomedical BERT-based model to perform two related ADR tasks: identifying if a text contains an adverse drug reaction, and extracting the specific ADR mention. We started with a pre-trained **PubMedBERT** model (leveraging its understanding of biomedical language) and showed that without fine-tuning it has no specific skill in ADR detection (yielding near-zero F1-scores). After training on the **ADE-Corpus V2 dataset**, the model achieved high precision and recall in both tasks, successfully learning to recognize ADRs.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key takeaways:\n",
        "- Pre-trained transformers like BERT can be adapted to biomedical tasks. Domain-specific models (**PubMedBERT**, **BioClinicalBERT**) are preferred for medical text as they capture domain terminology.\n",
        "- Fine-tuning on labeled data is essential for the model to perform the specific task – as we saw, the base model needed task-specific examples to learn what counts as an ADR.\n",
        "- We evaluated our models with precision, recall, and F1. After training, the classifier accurately detects ADR mentions (few false negatives, as shown by high recall, and few false positives, as shown by high precision), and the NER model reliably extracts the ADR terms from text. These metrics are crucial in healthcare NLP: a high-recall ADR detector can help catch most adverse events, while precision ensures we don’t flag too many false alarms.\n",
        "\n",
        "Using **Hugging Face’s Transformers** and **Datasets** libraries in a **Colab** environment allows for a streamlined workflow – from dataset preparation to model training and evaluation – all in a few dozen lines of code. This makes advanced NLP techniques accessible to healthcare professionals with basic coding skills.\n",
        "\n",
        "By following this tutorial, you can apply a similar approach to other biomedical NLP problems: choose a relevant pre-trained model, obtain an annotated dataset for your task, fine-tune with appropriate metrics, and evaluate the improvements. With these tools, one can build models to aid in automated extraction of critical information from clinical texts, ultimately supporting healthcare decisions and research.\n",
